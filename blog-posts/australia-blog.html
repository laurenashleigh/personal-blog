                        <h3>Skydiving over Fraser Island</h3>
                        <p class="blog-text">
                            At 10am I thought about conquering my fear of freefalling, at 1pm I jumped out of a plane at 15000ft. We were just having breakfast when I said ‘apparently there’s a place to skydive around here’, more of a fact than a suggestion, next thing I know Simon is on the phone saying ‘here are my card details, yep I understand it’s non-refundable, see you in 3 hours!’
                            Once I realised I had to make the decision between facing my one fear and losing 300 dollars I began to panic. I paced with sweaty hands and shallow breaths around Simon, imagining the moment of jumping over and over in my mind. Sky diving is something I’ve wanted to do since I began watching I’m A Celebrity at the age of 6, but I’ve also been acutely aware that I would never be able to let go once sitting on the edge of the plane. But now it was booked and I had exactly 3 hours to mentally prepare. 
                            
                            After reading a few blogs on the car journey up to rainbow beach, I found little reassurance. When the internal prep talk of ‘Be brave’ didn’t suffice, it became ‘think of the Instagram story’ and that made me feel just a little more willing. 
                            It was soon time to enter the studio and sign away my agreement to compensation-free injury and death. After the 5th trip to the toilet we were strapped up into safety harnesses and driven to the runway. The site of a tiny plane whose insides were partly covered by gaffa tape did nothing to calm my nerves. As we ascended I was only partly listening as my instructor explained what to do when jumping and landing, distracted by both the amazing view over Fraser Island and the intense fear as I anticipated the jump. We reached 15000 feet, time to go. First up was simon who was as relaxed as if he was taking up position in a cinema. 3..2..1.. he dropped out of view. We moved to the edge, ‘don’t look down, don’t look down’, feet under, back arched, head up. 3..2.. “Lauren say hi to the camera” GO
                            
                            And this was it. I was freefalling 15000 ft above sea level. We tumbled in the air for 3 seconds and then wow. I was floating above a blanket of blue with 200km/hour winds pushing against my open arms. 
                            The parachute was pulled, he gave me control and I turned in the wind to face one of the most incredible coast lines in eastern Australia. The goggles came off and now I could truly enjoy the view. The ground came towards us all too soon and we landed as practised next to Simon on the sand.
