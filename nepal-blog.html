                        <h3>Trekking the Himalayas</h3>
                        <p class="blog-text">
                            Hiking the Annapurna circuit was, besides a Biochemistry degree, one of the toughest things I’ve ever done. Arriving in Thamel with just sports leggings, a hoodie and a leaky water pouch, I was woefully underprepared. The initial intention to hike for a few days was unexpectantly quadrupled to 12 days as I booked on to walk the Annapurna circuit. I acquired warmer clothes from Iris, a girl I previously befriended in Vietnam, and met one hiking companion in my hostel in Thamel and three others on my bus journey to Basi Saha, the starting point of the trek. We were one English, one Dutch, two Germans and an Israeli. 
                            I was the least prepared with my old worn-out Reeboks and non-existent walking poles. The German couple were incredibly organised with their 2 pairs of hiking boots, Suunto watch and PeakFinder app, a clear giveaway that we’d not be sticking to a standard hiking trail. The Israeli, conveniently called Yisrael, was also prepared with his 3 bags of coffee, 4 packets of biscuits and a gas stove together with pots and cups. The 5th member of the group, a Dutch girl called Denise, abandoned us for a new, slower, group shortly after learning our plans to overshoot our first recommended destination by 150%. As it happened, we walked almost 35km on the first day, arriving at the Guest House in Timang well after sunset. Everyday we set off before sunrise and arrived after sunset. Even on our rest day in Manang, the crazy Germans convinced me to hike over 1000 meters to the Ice Lake as it was ´good for acclimatisation`. Dhal baht and muesli became our super foods but after 4 days of eating nothing else, the thought of them soon turned our stomach. Hiking in the high altitude was a contrast of burning heat when under the strong sun rays, and rapidly loosing the feeling in your fingers and nose in the shadows. Nights brought temperatures of minus 15 degrees, meaning we all gathered around the wood-fuelled oven in the guest houses until the fire burnt out and we had to retire to bed in the freezing cabins. I wasn`t smart enough to have packed a sleeping bag and paying money for an extra blanket would have to wait until I got frostbite. I drank lake water purified with chlorine tablets and ate salted boiled pasta with Yisrael for lunch, sometimes it was gourmet if we managed to buy a tin of tuna from the guest house kitchen. 

                            In 8 days we hiked 150km and climbed over 7600 meters. I had minor altitude sickness – severe headaches and nosebleeds- in the days approaching the Thorung La pass crossing at 5416 meters above sea level, but thanks to my well-worn sneakers I didn´t obtain a single blister.
